					Congratulations! You have been sorted into the boldest of all the houses. As per your choices, the most suitable house for you is Gryffindor! Founded by Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts, this house treasured the bravest and boldest. Just like them, you always tend to do what seems fair. Although, sometimes you act without thinking first, which may leave you in trouble in the future. You will do almost anything for your friend, even run into a burning building to rescue them! Your house often gets along best with other Gryffindors or Hufflepuff's.

					Congratulations! You are in the most ambitious house of all! You are in Slytherin! Founded by Salazar Slytherin, one of the four house founders of Hogwarts, this house chose to teach the most cunning. The house emblem of Slytherin is a snake. Like yourself, the snake is sleek. Slytherins are known to be the most cunning and ambitious. Slytherin has produced the most Dark Wizards, but they have also produced their shares of good wizards too. Just like them, you are also determined and aspiring to reach your goal and beat others. However, you may have a reputation of being a bit insensitive and thinking of yourself above others. You, like Gryffindor, are also very brave but tend to be more careful of yourself than saving others. Thus, you always seem to be safer than Gryffindors. Your house gets along best with each other and gets together least with Gryffindors.

					Congratulations on making the most ingenious house of them all! You are in Ravenclaw! Founded by Rowena Ravenclaw, Ravenclaw treasures those who learn and have the most knowledgeable minds. The house emblem is an eagle "where it soars where others cannot climb"-Pottermore. Ravenclaws are the cleverest and wisest of them all! Ravenclaw's are known to be the most intelligent of them all! Just like them, you are determined to do well and be known as the most brilliant of them all. Although, we assume that you may be known to backstab others to do well on tests and succeed with your goals and ambitions. You may also be known as a show-off, only because some people may be jealous of your cleverness. Ravenclaws are sometimes remembered as eccentric. However, Ravenclaws treasure these oddballs above ordinary people. Ravenclaws are the wisest!

					Congratulations! You belong to the kindest of them all! You are in Hufflepuff! Founded by Helga Hufflepuff, the Hufflepuff treasured the honest and kind. According to the sorting hat song, Hufflepuff was kind and usually took the rest of the wizards. They are known to get along with most of the houses due to their kindness. Hufflepuffs are known to be loyal. You are the most helpful out of all three houses. Although you may have a reputation amongst the other houses as not the sharpest tool in the shed, however, this is mostly untrue, only because Hufflepuff's don't show off. However, your home seems to be the house with the least amount of famous wizards, both good and bad, or this is perhaps because Hufflepuffs are more modest than the Slytherins, Gryffindors, and Ravenclaws. Hufflepuff has produced the least amount of dark wizards.
