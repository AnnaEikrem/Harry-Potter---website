						You have been sorted into the boldest of all the houses, Gryffindor! Founded by Godric Gryffindor, this house is considered the bravest and boldest. You tend to do what seems fair, although you sometimes act without thinking first, which may leave you in trouble in the future. You will do almost anything for your friend and your house often gets along best with other Gryffindors or Hufflepuff's.

					<article class="sortinghat__results-text" data-house="Slytherin">
						<h4 class="sortinghat__result-headline">
							Congratulations
						</h4>
						
						You are in Slytherin, the most ambitious house of all! Founded by Salazar Slytherin, this house chose to teach the most cunning. Slytherins are known to be the most cunning and ambitious and the house has produced the most Dark Wizards. Slytherin's are determined and aspire to reach their goal and beat others and may have a reputation of being insensitive. Like Gryffindor, you are also  brave but tend to be more careful of yourself than saving others. Your house gets along best with each other and gets together least with Gryffindors.

					<article class="sortinghat__results-text" data-house="Ravenclaw">
						<h4 class="sortinghat__result-headline">
							Congratulations
						</h4>

						You are in Ravenclaw! The house founded by Rowena Ravenclaw, treasures those who learn and have the most knowledgeable minds. Ravenclaws are the cleverest and wisest of them all! Just like them, you are determined to do well and be known as the most brilliant of them all. Although, we assume that you may be known to backstab others to do well on tests and succeed with your goals and ambitions. Ravenclaws are sometimes remembered as eccentric. However, Ravenclaws treasure these oddballs above ordinary people.

					<article class="sortinghat__results-text" data-house="Hufflepuff">
						<h4 class="sortinghat__result-headline">
							Congratulations
						</h4>

						You belong to the kindest of them all,Hufflepuff! The house founded by Helga Hufflepuff, treasured the honest and kind. They are known to get along with most of the houses due to their kindness. Hufflepuffs are known to be loyal and helpful. Although you may have a reputation amongst the other houses as not being the sharpest tool in the shed, this is mostly untrue. Hufflepuff's don't show off. Being more modest, Hufflepuff have the least amount of famous wizards.
